# JUAD-HMPSO

A trial to apply HMPSO algorithm to  maximise   bit rate in a D2D communication environment while allocating both uplink and down link resources of DUE (Joint Uplink and Downlink Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlying Cellular Networks).  Part of a simulation project in the course Mobile Telecom Networks - BITS Goa
